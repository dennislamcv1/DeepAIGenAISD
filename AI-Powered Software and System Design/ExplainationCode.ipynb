    "# Programming Assignment: Social Network Database Fix\n",
    "\n",
    "## Welcome!\n",
    "\n",
    "You've reached a practical part of our course, **Generative AI for Software Development - AI-Powered Software and System Design**. This task is all about diving into a database designed for managing a social network. It's a hands-on challenge to test your skills and see how well you can work with AI tools, like a Language Learning Model (LLM).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Mission\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to fix a database code that's not working right. It's supposed to handle a social network with two main parts: a `Person` table and a `Club` table. There's a mistake in the code, and it's up to you to find and correct it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fix the Database:** Hunt down the mistake messing up the database and correct it.\n",
    "2. **Write Three Functions:** Use the LLM to help you craft three functions. They should:\n",
    "   - List all members of a specific club.\n",
    "   - List all friends of a specific person.\n",
    "   - List all people who consider a specific person their friend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with the LLM:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ask the LLM for Help:** Use the LLM to guide you through fixing the database and creating your functions.\n",
    "- **Use Its Advice Wisely:** Remember, the LLM's advice might not always be spot-on. It's up to you to decide what's useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to Submit:\n",
    "\n",
    "Please submit this Jupyter notebook containing:\n",
    "- The corrected database code.\n",
    "- The three functions you've written.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How We'll Grade It:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Database Accuracy:** We'll check if you've successfully identified and fixed the issue in the database.\n",
    "- **Functionality of Your Functions:** We'll see if each of your functions is doing exactly what it's supposed to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips for Success:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Be Clear with Your Questions:** The clearer your questions to the LLM, the better help you'll get.\n",
    "- **Test the Advice:** Always test out the LLM’s suggestions to ensure they work as expected.\n",
    "- **Hints**: If you struggle with this assignment, you can check some hints we left to you in the bottom of the assignment!"

    "This code is setting up the foundation for interacting with a relational database using SQLAlchemy, a popular Python ORM (Object Relational Mapper). Here’s a breakdown of each part:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **SQLAlchemy Imports**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, ForeignKey, Table\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`create_engine`**: Used to establish a connection to the database. You will pass a database URL (e.g., for SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL) to create a connection that SQLAlchemy will use to interact with the database.\n",
    "- **`Column`**: Defines the columns in a database table. You will use this to specify the attributes of your model (e.g., ID, name) and their types.\n",
    "- **`Integer`, `String`**: These are data types for the columns (similar to SQL types). `Integer` represents an integer type, and `String` represents text data.\n",
    "- **`ForeignKey`**: Used to define a relationship between tables (typically linking a column in one table to the primary key of another table).\n",
    "- **`Table`**: Can be used to define association tables for many-to-many relationships between two other tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`declarative_base`**: This is a factory function that creates a base class for declarative class definitions. All your table models (Python classes representing tables) will inherit from this base.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship, sessionmaker\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`relationship`**: This function is used to define relationships between tables (models) in SQLAlchemy, such as one-to-many or many-to-many relationships.\n",
    "- **`sessionmaker`**: This function is used to create session factories. A session in SQLAlchemy is where you handle transactions with the database (querying, updating, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Other Imports**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import os\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`numpy`**: This library is widely used for numerical computations, but in this code, it's not clear how it’s going to be used yet. It might be used for manipulating numerical data that's later stored or queried from the database.\n",
    "- **`os`**: This module provides functions for interacting with the operating system. It can be used for file paths, environment variables, and other OS-level operations. Again, its purpose here is not clear yet, but it could be for accessing environment variables (like database credentials) or file handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "This code is preparing to work with a database using SQLAlchemy’s ORM capabilities. It's defining tools to create tables (using the `declarative_base` model) and define relationships between them. The final database interactions, such as establishing connections, defining specific models, or running queries, will likely follow later in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re also importing `numpy` and `os`, which might be used in data processing and system interaction later in the project."

Identifying the bugs directly from the code might be challenging for an LLM, **so you might need to implement some of the functions to better understand the issues**. Your analytical skills will be crucial.

Ensure that you address the issues in the code provided!\n",

    "```python\n",
    "clubs = []\n",
    "for description in club_descriptions:\n",

    "```\n",
    "- Each club is assigned a random number (between 5 and 10) of members, who are randomly chosen from the `people` dataset.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "session.commit()\n",
    "session.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "- All the changes are committed to the database, and the session is closed.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "The function sets up a SQLite database representing a social network, where people can be friends and belong to clubs. It defines models for `Person` and `Club`, creates relationships between them, and populates the database with random people, friendships, and clubs."
